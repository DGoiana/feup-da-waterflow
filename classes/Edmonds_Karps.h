 * @brief Edmonds Karp Algorithm to determine a graph's Max-Flow

 * residual graph, after that it finds the minimum flow following that path and stores it which will contribute to the
 * final Max-Flow value. With the min-flow value and the new augmented graph, the algorithms is ready for the next
 * iteration. Those steps are repeated until there is no path between the source node and the target node.\n\n
